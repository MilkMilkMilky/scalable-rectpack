## Overview

The Scalable 2D Rectangle Packing Tool is a flexible and efficient solution for the 2D bin packing problem, where rectangles of varying sizes need to be placed inside a bounded area with minimal wasted space.

## Features

- üìè Scalable & Flexible ‚Äì Supports rectangles with adjustable dimensions and constraints.
- ‚ö° Optimization-Driven ‚Äì Minimizes wasted area while ensuring feasible placement.
- üß© General-Purpose ‚Äì Applicable in layout design, photo walls, cutting stock, game level
- üìä Visualization Ready ‚Äì Integrated plotting functions to visualize packing results.
- üî¨ Research & Practical Use ‚Äì Useful both for algorithmic experimentation and real-world
